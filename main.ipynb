At first, I was resistant to this change because it meant starting over in a different area. In my previous role, I had spent the last three years improving the quality of work and processes and perfecting my job. I struggled with the idea of leaving all that behind and starting again in a new role. I also have to admit that I was afraid of failure. In the past, I often preferred success and confirmation over challenges, which is typical of a fixed mindset. While working on my assignment about the growth mindset, I gained a new perspective that completely changed my mindset. I realized that this change is not a step backward, but an opportunity to grow and move forward. It allows me to acquire new skills, prove my abilities once again, and further develop both professionally and personally. I now understand that staying in my old role would not have given me the same opportunities to learn and grow. I have also noticed that this way of thinking had a positive impact on my colleagues at work, who are also struggling with this reorganization. Of course, it will be a big challenge for all of us, but it can also lead to future growth opportunities.

In dieser kurzen Übung werden Sie drei kurze Schritte durchlaufen, um klare, erreichbare Ziele zu setzen, die Ihnen vor dem Hintergrund dieses Seminars wichtig sind. <strong>Nutzen Sie die Coaching-Funktion AI Assist von Rflect,</strong> um Ihre Ziele ggf. weiter zu verbessern bzw. noch präziser zu formulieren, um die von Ihnen priorisierten Kompetenzen weiter zu stärken. Sie können diese Ziele später auf Ihrem Lernweg und im Rahmen des Leistungsnachweises überprüfen.</p>",

Provide reasoning first and then the coaching. You will conduct three steps internally, but make sure only show step four in your output.\\n\\n*To complete the task, follow the three steps*\\n1. Identify the language in which the student has written their text. Provide your coaching in the same language as the student's text.\\n2. Identify the steps from the Gibbs reflective cycle that are already in the text and those that may be missing. Your feedback should address the elements that are missing. The feedback should encourage students to engage more with their reflection and improve their reflective writing skills.\\n3. Also help the student to progress on the subject-matter that the student is reflecting about. The coaching should include both the process of reflection and the content of the reflection.\\n4. Formulate your coaching based on the following instructions:\\nStart with something encouraging. If students only provide bullet points or short sentences encourage them to write more.\\n\\n*Output instructions*\\n - Start with something positive and encouraging.\\n - Provide one to a maximum of two open questions (like Why, How and What) to engage more deeply with the reflections and the content of the reflection. Ensure your feedback is only up to 50 words (less is fine too).\\n - Do not use bullet points.\\n - Use an informal but polite language, be concise, and address the students in the second singular form.\\n - If the student text is less than 20 words, state that it is too short to provide helpful feedback and provide one small idea to get started.\\n\\n\\n\", \"temperature\": 0.4, \"suggestion_type\": \"regular-suggestion\", \"time_to_generate\": 1406}"

These competencies shape how we manage ourselves, relate to others, and respond to challenges. They are key to personal development, emotional well-being, and success in both personal and professional spheres.

Later on, we will dive deeper into them and practice them with exercises and actions. </p>",

The average life time of a city tree is 30 years. I think it represents this conflict we have with nature. We know we need trees for our health but we struggle to find room for them. It is more valuable to have  buildings for the economy of the town than not being able to dig or build near the root zone of a tree. So tree pays the price but ultimately it is us. It is also not very economical in regards to tree and labor cost, Co2 take up and storage to replace a city tree every 20-30years. In the future we need to calculate cost more long term and holistic to measure the value of a living tree in town differently.",

What specific actions could cities take to better integrate trees into urban planning? This could lead to a richer discussion about sustainability and long-term benefits.",

The average life time of a city tree is 30 years. I think it represents this conflict we have with nature. We know we need trees for our health but we struggle to find room for them. The way we calculate at the moment, we value apartment and commerce buildings higher for the economy of a town than a tree  who`s roots should not be damaged . So the tree pays the price but ultimately it is us and our health. It is also not very economical in regards to tree purchasing price, labor cost, Co2 take up and storage to replace a city tree every 20-30years. If you compare his functions with a commercial CO2 storage facility we`d be valuing them different. Every tree should have a real time billboard funktion to show how much Co2 he stores, takes up and how many other health benefits he has for us per day and that translated into a monetary value. It would change peoples perception of trees.",

Het gaat niet alleen om het schrijven van duidelijke e-mails of het maken van gelikte presentaties - het gaat om het opbouwen van vertrouwen, het bevorderen van samenwerking en het tonen van emotionele intelligentie. Goede communicatoren passen hun toon en stijl aan verschillende belanghebbenden aan, navigeren moeilijke gesprekken met vertrouwen en luisteren net zo actief als ze spreken. Of het nu gaat om interactie met gasten, projectpartners of teamleden, communicatie vormt je professionele identiteit.</p><p>Naast professionele vaardigheden gaat het bij communicatie ook om zelfbewustzijn en aanwezigheid. Volledig aanwezig zijn en ons bewust zijn van de filters die we gebruiken bij het luisteren, kan de communicatie authentieker, empathischer en zinvoller maken.</p><p>Zoals gewoonlijk begin je de week met vragen over je motivatie en benodigde ondersteuning.

Wij zijn op zoek naar partners die dezelfde duurzaamheidsvisie delen als ons. Uw hotel, die zich vooral focust op milieuvriendelijke initiatieven, lijkt ons de perfecte partner om mee samen te werken.\nGraag zouden wij een afspraak met u inplannen om de mogelijkheden voor samenwerking te bespreken. Wij geloven dat een gezamenlijke promotie van een ecotoerismepakket zowel de positionering van uw hotel binnen de duurzame reismarkt als ons bereik vergroten, terwijl we samen bijdragen aan duurzaam toerisme. \nLaat u ons weten wanneer het u schikt voor een (online of fysieke) kennismaking?\nAlvast hartelijk dank voor uw tijd en overweging.

Um deine Reflexion zu vertiefen, könntest du darüber nachdenken, wie spezifische Erfahrungen in der Vergangenheit dir geholfen haben, mit Unsicherheiten umzugehen.

         "a) Unsicherheit hat einen Grund/ eine Ursache: z.b. wenn man sich nicht besonders gut in einem Bereich auskennt, deshalb denkt, man könnte scheitern, oder sich nicht zutraut, eine Aufgabe zu meistern. Meistens hat dies jedoch lediglich damit zu tun, dass man sich bisher (also bis anhin) wenig bis gar nicht mit der Thematik/ dem Bereich auseinandergesetzt hat; dies weil man schlicht nicht musste, konnte, durfte, oder wollte, was wiederum zahlreiche Gründe haben kann (keine Interesse an der Materie, keine Berührungspunkte in Familie, Beruf, Freizeit, Freundeskreis, oder aber weil man schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht und diese nicht aufgearbeitet hat, etc.). \n--> Wichtig ist also, dass man seine Ängste/Unsicherheiten zu analysieren lernt, und sich ihnen danach auch stellt. Oft ist es nämlich so, dass man rückblickend erkennt, dass die Unsicherheit/Angst unbegründet war (im Sinne von zu viel Respekt vor einer Aufgabe) und man sich etwas nicht zugetraut hat, was eigentlich nur deshalb der Fall war, weil man sich gar nie darauf eingelassen hat. Immer wenn man etwas Neues lernen will, oder wenn man sich mit einer unerwarteten Herausforderung oder einer Situation, die man so noch nicht erlebt hat, konfrontiert sieht und ergo über wenig prozedurales Wissen/ Erfahrung im Umgang damit verfügt, braucht es lediglich die Bereitschaft, sich darauf einzulassen und auf seine inneren Ressourcen zu vertrauen, und schon kommt es gut. Für mich persönlich gehören solche Situationen nicht nur zum Leben, sondern sie sind absolut essentiell für jegliche Form der persönlichen Weiterentwicklung. Und es gibt kaum etwas schöneres, finde ich, als sich solchen Herausforderungen zu stellen und an ihnen zu wachsen, dabei neue Kompetenzen zu erwerben und diese anzuwenden und einzusetzen. Dies gilt deshalb nicht nur für Punkt a), sondern auch für b) und c).",

         "A particularly challenging moment that tested my balance between openness and core values occurred during my time at Pro Femina e.V. I had been tasked with improving donor communication processes, a responsibility that required implementing more structured, automated systems to increase efficiency. However, many team members were deeply committed to a personal, relational approach and feared that automation would erode the human connection at the heart of their work.\n\nAt first, I felt torn. On one hand, my consulting background at Simon-Kucher & Partners and McKinsey had ingrained in me a strong belief in data-driven efficiency and structured workflows. On the other hand, I personally valued meaningful communication and understood the team’s emotional investment in their work. I experienced frustration – how could I respect their perspective while also pushing for necessary change? I also felt self-doubt: Was I imposing too much of a rigid mindset on an organization that thrived on relational engagement?\n\nTo navigate this tension, I took a step back and focused on understanding both perspectives. Instead of enforcing automation outright, I initiated conversations with the team to pinpoint their deepest concerns. Their fear wasn’t technology itself – it was losing the warmth and authenticity of personal outreach. This realization shifted my approach.\n\nI implemented a phased strategy: introducing CRM Dynamics 365 to handle routine follow-ups while keeping key touchpoints personalized. I also organized feedback sessions to ensure the new system complemented, rather than replaced, the team’s strengths. Initially, there was skepticism, but over time, the team saw that efficiency didn’t have to come at the expense of meaningful relationships.\n\nThis experience reinforced a crucial lesson: true leadership isn’t about choosing between efficiency and empathy – it’s about integrating both. By embracing discomfort, engaging in dialogue, and remaining flexible, I learned that adapting to new ideas doesn’t mean abandoning core values; it means strengthening them in new ways.",

Provide reasoning first and then the coaching. You will conduct three steps internally, but make sure only show step four in your output.\\n\\n*To complete the task, follow the three steps*\\n1. Identify the language in which the student has written their text. Provide your coaching in the same language as the student's text.\\n2. Identify the steps from the Gibbs reflective cycle that are already in the text and those that may be missing. Your feedback should address the elements that are missing. The feedback should encourage students to engage more with their reflection and improve their reflective writing skills.\\n3. Also help the student to progress on the subject-matter that the student is reflecting about. The coaching should include both the process of reflection and the content of the reflection.\\n4. Formulate your coaching based on the following instructions:\\nStart with something encouraging. If students only provide bullet points or short sentences encourage them to write more.\\n\\n*Output instructions*\\n - Start with something positive and encouraging.\\n - Provide one to a maximum of two open questions (like Why, How and What) to engage more deeply with the reflections and the content of the reflection. Ensure your feedback is only up to 50 words (less is fine too).\\n - Do not use bullet points.\\n - Use an informal but polite language, be concise, and address the students in the second singular form.\\n - If the student text is less than 20 words, state that it is too short to provide helpful feedback and provide one small idea to get started.\\n\\n\\n\", \"temperature\": 0.4, \"suggestion_type\": \"regular-suggestion\", \"time_to_generate\": 1112}"

Het gaat niet alleen om het schrijven van duidelijke e-mails of het maken van gelikte presentaties - het gaat om het opbouwen van vertrouwen, het bevorderen van samenwerking en het tonen van emotionele intelligentie. Goede communicatoren passen hun toon en stijl aan verschillende belanghebbenden aan, navigeren moeilijke gesprekken met vertrouwen en luisteren net zo actief als ze spreken. Of het nu gaat om interactie met gasten, projectpartners of teamleden, communicatie vormt je professionele identiteit.</p><p>Naast professionele vaardigheden gaat het bij communicatie ook om zelfbewustzijn en aanwezigheid. Volledig aanwezig zijn en ons bewust zijn van de filters die we gebruiken bij het luisteren, kan de communicatie authentieker, empathischer en zinvoller maken.</p><p>Zoals gewoonlijk begin je de week met vragen over je motivatie en benodigde ondersteuning.

Um deine Reflexion zu vertiefen, könntest du darüber nachdenken, wie spezifische Erfahrungen in der Vergangenheit dir geholfen haben, mit Unsicherheiten umzugehen.

         "a) Unsicherheit hat einen Grund/ eine Ursache: z.b. wenn man sich nicht besonders gut in einem Bereich auskennt, deshalb denkt, man könnte scheitern, oder sich nicht zutraut, eine Aufgabe zu meistern. Meistens hat dies jedoch lediglich damit zu tun, dass man sich bisher (also bis anhin) wenig bis gar nicht mit der Thematik/ dem Bereich auseinandergesetzt hat; dies weil man schlicht nicht musste, konnte, durfte, oder wollte, was wiederum zahlreiche Gründe haben kann (keine Interesse an der Materie, keine Berührungspunkte in Familie, Beruf, Freizeit, Freundeskreis, oder aber weil man schlechte Erfahrungen gemacht und diese nicht aufgearbeitet hat, etc.). \n--> Wichtig ist also, dass man seine Ängste/Unsicherheiten zu analysieren lernt, und sich ihnen danach auch stellt. Oft ist es nämlich so, dass man rückblickend erkennt, dass die Unsicherheit/Angst unbegründet war (im Sinne von zu viel Respekt vor einer Aufgabe) und man sich etwas nicht zugetraut hat, was eigentlich nur deshalb der Fall war, weil man sich gar nie darauf eingelassen hat. Immer wenn man etwas Neues lernen will, oder wenn man sich mit einer unerwarteten Herausforderung oder einer Situation, die man so noch nicht erlebt hat, konfrontiert sieht und ergo über wenig prozedurales Wissen/ Erfahrung im Umgang damit verfügt, braucht es lediglich die Bereitschaft, sich darauf einzulassen und auf seine inneren Ressourcen zu vertrauen, und schon kommt es gut. Für mich persönlich gehören solche Situationen nicht nur zum Leben, sondern sie sind absolut essentiell für jegliche Form der persönlichen Weiterentwicklung. Und es gibt kaum etwas schöneres, finde ich, als sich solchen Herausforderungen zu stellen und an ihnen zu wachsen, dabei neue Kompetenzen zu erwerben und diese anzuwenden und einzusetzen. Dies gilt deshalb nicht nur für Punkt a), sondern auch für b) und c).",

         "A particularly challenging moment that tested my balance between openness and core values occurred during my time at Pro Femina e.V. I had been tasked with improving donor communication processes, a responsibility that required implementing more structured, automated systems to increase efficiency. However, many team members were deeply committed to a personal, relational approach and feared that automation would erode the human connection at the heart of their work.\n\nAt first, I felt torn. On one hand, my consulting background at Simon-Kucher & Partners and McKinsey had ingrained in me a strong belief in data-driven efficiency and structured workflows. On the other hand, I personally valued meaningful communication and understood the team’s emotional investment in their work. I experienced frustration – how could I respect their perspective while also pushing for necessary change? I also felt self-doubt: Was I imposing too much of a rigid mindset on an organization that thrived on relational engagement?\n\nTo navigate this tension, I took a step back and focused on understanding both perspectives. Instead of enforcing automation outright, I initiated conversations with the team to pinpoint their deepest concerns. Their fear wasn’t technology itself – it was losing the warmth and authenticity of personal outreach. This realization shifted my approach.\n\nI implemented a phased strategy: introducing CRM Dynamics 365 to handle routine follow-ups while keeping key touchpoints personalized. I also organized feedback sessions to ensure the new system complemented, rather than replaced, the team’s strengths. Initially, there was skepticism, but over time, the team saw that efficiency didn’t have to come at the expense of meaningful relationships.\n\nThis experience reinforced a crucial lesson: true leadership isn’t about choosing between efficiency and empathy – it’s about integrating both. By embracing discomfort, engaging in dialogue, and remaining flexible, I learned that adapting to new ideas doesn’t mean abandoning core values; it means strengthening them in new ways.",

Provide reasoning first and then the coaching. You will conduct three steps internally, but make sure only show step four in your output.\\n\\n*To complete the task, follow the three steps*\\n1. Identify the language in which the student has written their text. Provide your coaching in the same language as the student's text.\\n2. Identify the steps from the Gibbs reflective cycle that are already in the text and those that may be missing. Your feedback should address the elements that are missing. The feedback should encourage students to engage more with their reflection and improve their reflective writing skills.\\n3. Also help the student to progress on the subject-matter that the student is reflecting about. The coaching should include both the process of reflection and the content of the reflection.\\n4. Formulate your coaching based on the following instructions:\\nStart with something encouraging. If students only provide bullet points or short sentences encourage them to write more.\\n\\n*Output instructions*\\n - Start with something positive and encouraging.\\n - Provide one to a maximum of two open questions (like Why, How and What) to engage more deeply with the reflections and the content of the reflection. Ensure your feedback is only up to 50 words (less is fine too).\\n - Do not use bullet points.\\n - Use an informal but polite language, be concise, and address the students in the second singular form.\\n - If the student text is less than 20 words, state that it is too short to provide helpful feedback and provide one small idea to get started.\\n\\n\\n\", \"temperature\": 0.4, \"suggestion_type\": \"regular-suggestion\", \"time_to_generate\": 1112}"

Erst durften nur noch die Abiturjahrgänge beschult werden, dann keiner mehr. Auf einmal saß man im März zu Hause herum, mit einer der wegweisendsten Klausuren des Lebens im Kopf, und mit sehr viel Unsicherheit. Plattformen mussten aus dem Boden gestampft werden, um die Abiturvorbereitung digital fortführen zu können. Zukunftsangst machte sich breit, reihenweise fielen Termine aus. Der Abiball, die Jahrgangsreise nach Schweden, auch eigene Auslandspläne. \nEs galt sich unter einem gewissen Zeit- und Leistungsdruck ein Level an Selbstorganisation aufzubauen, zu einer Zeit in der Kontakte mit Angehörigen nicht gepflegt werden durften, zu der täglich neue Schreckensmeldungen durch die Medien geisterten – keine leichte Aufgabe. Im Großen und Ganzen ein Kampf gegen die Überforderung mit sich selbst und mit den ganzen Geschehnissen auf der Welt. Ich denke den meisten wird es nicht anders gegangen sein, jeder war auf seine Weise vom Virus betroffen. \n\nAnalyse\nIch denke durch ruckartige, wahrnehmbare Veränderungen zu dieser Zeit hat man das erste Mal ein Bewusstsein für das entwickelt, was Rosa Beschleunigung nennt. Die technischen Veränderungen (Online-Schooling) waren von heute auf morgen gesetzt, man musste sich anpassen, oder fiel zurück. Auch der soziale Wandel war sofort wahrnehmbar: Distanz, neue Umgangsformen, Kontakt zur Aussenwelt nur noch digital. \nObwohl Freizeitaktivitäten wegfielen, entstand für mich in dieser Phase nicht das Gefühl von mehr Zeit, die ich nun zur Verfügung hätte. Die Veränderung, verbunden mit der Berichterstattung und Zukunftsungewissheit, prägte das wahrgenommene Lebenstempo.  \nParallel galt es sich noch vernünftig auf eine zentrale Lebensprüfung vorzubereiten.

         "A defining moment in my professional journey occurred during my time as a Senior Partner Assistant at Simon-Kucher & Partners. I was responsible for coordinating a high-stakes client presentation. Confident in my experience, I insisted that my approach to structuring the deck was the most effective, despite a colleague suggesting an alternative format.\n\nHowever, during the presentation, it became evident that my structure was not as intuitive as I had thought. The client struggled to follow the flow, and I realized too late that my colleague’s suggestion might have been the better choice. It was a humbling realization—I had been so convinced of my approach that I dismissed valuable input.\n\nAcknowledging my mistake was uncomfortable, but I knew it was necessary. I approached my colleague, admitted that I should have been more open, and thanked them for their perspective. Their response was surprisingly positive; instead of criticism, I received understanding, and our discussion led to a stronger collaboration moving forward. This experience reinforced an essential lesson: humility is not about diminishing oneself but about embracing the wisdom of others.\n\nStrengthening Team Communication\n\nSince that moment, I have actively worked on improving how I communicate and collaborate with others. I started implementing regular feedback loops, where I encourage colleagues to challenge my ideas before finalizing decisions. Additionally, I have made a conscious effort to ask open-ended questions such as, “How do you see this?” or “Would you approach this differently?”—creating space for diverse input.\n\nAnother key change was fostering psychological safety in my team. I openly admit when I am uncertain or when I need help, signaling to others that it is okay to do the same. Over time, this shift has led to a culture of trust where people feel empowered to speak up, leading to more well-rounded decisions.\n\nIn future situations, I will continue to prioritize collective intelligence over individual certainty. The best ideas emerge when we listen, adapt, and grow together—because success is not about being right but about getting it right as a team.\n\nHumility taught me that collaboration thrives when ego is set aside.

Leadership, to me, is not about having all the answers but about creating a space where diverse perspectives drive the best outcomes. Moving forward, I will implement three key actions to ensure my teams feel valued and heard:\n\n\t1.\tEncouraging Open Dialogue – I will establish a culture where constructive disagreement is welcomed. This means actively seeking out differing viewpoints and making it clear that speaking up is not just accepted but expected.\n\t2.\tInclusive Decision-Making – Before making key decisions, I will introduce structured brainstorming sessions where each team member has a chance to contribute. By integrating tools like anonymous feedback channels, I can ensure that even quieter voices are part of the conversation.\n\t3.\tLeading with Vulnerability – I will normalize admitting when I don’t have all the answers. When leaders model humility, they create an environment where team members feel comfortable acknowledging their own learning curves and collaborating more openly.\n\nUltimately, this experience has taught me that leadership is not about being the smartest person in the room – it’s about creating a room where everyone can be smart together. By fostering a team culture built on trust, humility, and inclusivity, I know that the best ideas will emerge, and success will be truly shared.",

It was a humbling realization – I had been so convinced of my approach that I dismissed valuable input.\n\nAcknowledging my mistake was uncomfortable, but I knew it was necessary. I approached my colleague, admitted that I should have been more open, and thanked them for their perspective. Instead of criticism, I received understanding, and our discussion led to a stronger collaboration moving forward. This experience reinforced an essential lesson: humility is not about diminishing oneself but about embracing the wisdom of others.\n\nThis experience profoundly shaped how I want to lead in the future. Leadership, to me, is not about having all the answers but about creating a space where diverse perspectives drive the best outcomes. Moving forward, I will implement three key actions to ensure my teams feel valued and heard:\n\n\t1.\tEncouraging Open Dialogue – I will establish a culture where constructive disagreement is welcomed. This means actively seeking out differing viewpoints and making it clear that speaking up is not just accepted but expected.\n\t2.\tInclusive Decision-Making – Before making key decisions, I will introduce structured brainstorming sessions where each team member has a chance to contribute. By integrating tools like anonymous feedback channels, I can ensure that even quieter voices are part of the conversation.\n\t3.\tLeading with Vulnerability – I will normalize admitting when I don’t have all the answers. When leaders model humility, they create an environment where team members feel comfortable acknowledging their own learning curves and collaborating more openly.\n\nUltimately, this experience has taught me that leadership is not about being the smartest person in the room – it’s about creating a room where everyone can be smart together. By fostering a team culture built on trust, humility, and inclusivity, I know that the best ideas will emerge, and success will be truly shared.",

         "Navigating professional challenges often tests our values and resilience. One memorable instance in my career occurred when I worked under a narcissistic boss. The work itself was meaningful, and I was genuinely passionate about my role. However, the environment demanded that I prioritize professionalism over values like fairness and transparency. To maintain harmony, I refrained from criticizing him, took blame that wasn’t mine, and avoided confrontation—choices that didn’t sit comfortably with me.\n\nThe challenge was twofold: preserving my integrity while navigating a toxic dynamic. Despite the difficulty, I recognized that my immediate goal was to ensure the quality of my work and uphold my professional demeanor. This approach allowed me to stay focused on tasks that mattered to me, but it also made me reflect deeply on the cost of compromising core values. The experience underscored the importance of psychological safety in a workplace and how much it impacts one’s ability to thrive.\n\nUltimately, my contract ended and wasn’t renewed, which, in hindsight, became a turning point. While the outcome felt disheartening initially, it was liberating to step away from a toxic environment. I gained valuable insights about identifying narcissistic traits early and learned strategies to manage them without losing myself—skills that have since shaped how I approach professional relationships.\n\nThis experience has profoundly influenced my approach to workplace dynamics. Since then, I’ve become more deliberate in aligning my values with my professional choices. For instance, during job interviews, I prioritize asking questions about leadership styles and team culture to gauge their compatibility with my principles. In my roles, I actively promote transparency and fairness, such as encouraging open dialogue during team meetings and providing constructive feedback in a respectful manner. These practices ensure that my workplace is not only productive but also aligned with the values I hold dear.\n\nThis challenge strengthened my resolve to prioritize meaningful work alongside respectful, value-driven relationships.

Wij zijn op zoek naar partners die dezelfde duurzaamheidsvisie delen als ons. Uw hotel, die zich vooral focust op milieuvriendelijke initiatieven, lijkt ons de perfecte partner om mee samen te werken.\nGraag zouden wij een afspraak met u inplannen om de mogelijkheden voor samenwerking te bespreken. Wij geloven dat een gezamenlijke promotie van een ecotoerismepakket zowel de positionering van uw hotel binnen de duurzame reismarkt als ons bereik vergroten, terwijl we samen bijdragen aan duurzaam toerisme. \nLaat u ons weten wanneer het u schikt voor een (online of fysieke) kennismaking?\nAlvast hartelijk dank voor uw tijd en overweging.

When no one responded initially (not even my supervisor), I spoke up and presented two strong arguments in favor of \"yes.\" Immediately, my supervisor intervened, arguing for \"no\" based on a rather trivial reason. The entire team in the meeting sensed that this reaction was more of a personal attack against me than a disagreement.\nHere came the key moment: The project manager intervened and supported my position, even though I am not her direct employee, and she typically aligns with my supervisor, as they are on the same hierarchical level and usually back each other up. Although it might sound like a banal situation, such an empathic response is quite rare in my department. The other team members were also positively surprised by the project manager’s reaction, as she used her position of power appropriately in that moment. If she would not have intervened, it could have had an negative impact on the psychological safety in future meetings. This situation has reinforced the idea that in our team we can express our opinions and be supported in doing so.\nAfter the meeting, the project manager took my supervisor aside to discuss the situation. In the next meeting, she also thanked me for my contribution. This experience was particularly significant to me because I have been struggling with the tension between my supervisor and myself. Knowing that other leaders and colleagues support me, stand up for me, and show empathy gives me the strength to not give up in challenging situations. In the future, I will also try to show more empathy in similar situations to support my colleagues as well.",

Wij zijn op zoek naar partners die dezelfde duurzaamheidsvisie delen als ons. Uw hotel, die zich vooral focust op milieuvriendelijke initiatieven, lijkt ons de perfecte partner om mee samen te werken.\nGraag zouden wij een afspraak met u inplannen om de mogelijkheden voor samenwerking te bespreken. Wij geloven dat een gezamenlijke promotie van een ecotoerismepakket zowel de positionering van uw hotel binnen de duurzame reismarkt als ons bereik vergroten, terwijl we samen bijdragen aan duurzaam toerisme. \nLaat u ons weten wanneer het u schikt voor een (online of fysieke) kennismaking?\nAlvast hartelijk dank voor uw tijd en overweging. Ik kijk uit naar uw reactie.\n\nMet vriendelijke groet, \n\nMelissa van Welie\nMarketingassistent\nEcoVoyage\n242420@buas.nl\n0615263868",

When no one responded initially (not even my supervisor), I spoke up and presented two strong arguments in favor of \"yes.\" Immediately, my supervisor intervened, arguing for \"no\" based on a rather trivial reason. The entire team in the meeting sensed that this reaction was more of a personal attack against me than a disagreement.\nHere came the key moment: The project manager intervened and supported my position, even though I am not her direct employee, and she typically aligns with my supervisor, as they are on the same hierarchical level and usually back each other up. Although it might sound like a banal situation, such an empathic response is quite rare in my department. The other team members were also positively surprised by the project manager’s reaction, as she used her position of power appropriately in that moment. If she would not have intervened, it could have had an negative impact on the psychological safety in future meetings. This situation has reinforced the idea that in our team we can express our opinions and be supported in doing so.\nAfter the meeting, the project manager took my supervisor aside to discuss the situation. In the next meeting, she also thanked me for my contribution. This experience was particularly significant to me because I have been struggling with the tension between my supervisor and myself. Knowing that other leaders and colleagues support me, stand up for me, and show empathy gives me the strength to not give up in challenging situations. In the future, I will also try to show more empathy in similar situations to support my colleagues as well.",

Wij zijn op zoek naar partners die dezelfde duurzaamheidsvisie delen als ons. Uw hotel, die zich vooral focust op milieuvriendelijke initiatieven, lijkt ons de perfecte partner om mee samen te werken.\nGraag zouden wij een afspraak met u inplannen om de mogelijkheden voor samenwerking te bespreken. Wij geloven dat een gezamenlijke promotie van een ecotoerismepakket zowel de positionering van uw hotel binnen de duurzame reismarkt als ons bereik vergroten, terwijl we samen bijdragen aan duurzaam toerisme. \nLaat u ons weten wanneer het u schikt voor een (online of fysieke) kennismaking?\nAlvast hartelijk dank voor uw tijd en overweging. Ik kijk uit naar uw reactie.\n\nMet vriendelijke groet, \n\nMelissa van Welie\nMarketingassistent\nEcoVoyage\n242420@buas.nl\n0615263868",

         "At work, I experienced a situation involving power dynamics in which I was directly involved. During a meeting, the project manager asked for our opinion on a yes/no question. When no one responded initially (not even my supervisor), I spoke up and presented two strong arguments in favor of \"yes.\" Immediately, my supervisor intervened, arguing for \"no\" based on a rather trivial reason. The entire team in the meeting sensed that this reaction was more of a personal attack against me than a disagreement.\nHere came the key moment: The project manager intervened and supported my position, even though I am not her direct employee, and she typically aligns with my supervisor, as they are on the same hierarchical level and usually back each other up. Although it might sound like a banal situation, such an empathic response is quite rare in my department. The other team members were also positively surprised by the project manager’s reaction, as she used her position of power appropriately in that moment. If she would not have intervened, it could have had an negative impact on the psychological safety in future meetings. This situation has reinforced the idea that in our team we can express our opinions and be supported in doing so.\nAfter the meeting, the project manager took my supervisor aside to discuss the situation. In the next meeting, she also thanked me for my contribution. This experience was particularly significant to me because I have been struggling with the tension between my supervisor and myself. Knowing that other leaders and colleagues support me, stand up for me, and show empathy gives me the strength to not give up in challenging situations. In the future, I will also try to show more empathy in similar situations to support my colleagues as well.",
